# Simple Sumo Robot using PIC 16f877a microcontroller

In order to fulfill the requirements of the Embedded Systems course at Princess Sumaya University for Technology - PSUT, a project was undertaken to create a basic Sumo robot using the micro c programming language. The primary goal of the project was not to create a highly advanced robot, but rather to teach students how to effectively interface analog and digital sensors with a PIC microcontroller.

The robot was equipped with three sensors and four actuators, including an analog ultrasonic sensor (hc-sr04) and a digital IR sensor capable of detecting white color.

### Used Parts
1. Ultrasonic Sensor hc-sr04 (Analog)
2. IR sensor to detect the white color (Digital) 
3. 4-Gearbox actuators 

All important info are commented in the c file. 

Thank you!
